8,assistant,"Thank you for providing the most recent opinions. Based on the correct breakdown and order of operations provided by the other agents, here is the finalized solution:

Given expression: 7 + 0*1 + 9 - 25*0

Following the order of operations:

Multiplication first:
0*1 = 0
25*0 = 0

Substitute back into the expression:
7 + 0 + 9 - 0

Now perform addition and subtraction:
7 + 0 + 9 = 16

Therefore, the correct result of 7 + 0*1 + 9 - 25*0 is 16."

1*20 = 20
4*16 = 64

Next, we perform the addition and subtraction in order from left to right:
10 + 20 = 30
30 + 4 = 34
34 - 64 = -30

Therefore, the result of 10+1*20+4-4*16 is -30.```

The expression 4+26*1+17-0*7 simplifies to:
4 + 26*1 + 17 - 0*7
= 4 + 26 + 17 - 0
= 30 + 17 - 0
= 47

Therefore, the result of 4+26*1+17-0*7 is 47.```

98,assistant,"In the expression 4 + 26*1 + 17 - 0*7, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS).

1. Perform multiplication and division: 26 * 1 = 26 and 0 * 7 = 0
2. Add and subtract from left to right: 4 + 26 + 17 - 0

Now we can simplify the expression:
= 4 + 26 + 17 - 0
= 30 + 17 - 0
= 47 - 0
= 47

Therefore, the correct result of the expression 4 + 26*1 + 17 - 0*7 is indeed 47."
