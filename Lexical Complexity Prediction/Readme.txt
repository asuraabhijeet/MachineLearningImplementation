run_train.ipynb file will need a train data file to run. The output will be model weight.

run_prediction.ipynb will use the stored model weight to calculate the prediction.

run_prediction file will use a test data file.

Each file uses preprocessing on the data set.

run_prediction file can take some time as it takes time to download embedding for preprocessing. Overall runtime is not for calculating predictions.

The values of hyperparameters are included in ipynb files.

The weights are included for run_prediction file.
